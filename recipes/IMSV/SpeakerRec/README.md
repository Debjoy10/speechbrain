# Speaker recognition experiments for I-MSV Challenge.
This folder contains scripts for running speaker identification and verification experiments with the I-MSV Dataset.

# Speaker verification using ECAPA-TDNN embeddings
Run the following command to train speaker embeddings using [ECAPA-TDNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07143):

`python train_speaker_embeddings.py hparams/train_ecapa_tdnn.yaml`

After training the speaker embeddings, it is possible to perform speaker verification using cosine similarity, like:

| Split      | Command |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Validation, En-En comparisons | `python speaker_verification_cosine.py hparams/verification_ecapa_trained.yaml` |
| Test, Crosslingual comparisons   | `python speaker_verification_cosine.py hparams/verification_ecapa_trained_test.yaml` |

**FOR TEST ONLY:** In case of compute issues, break config file into multiple smaller config files containing less comparisons each. Bash file `< BASH_FILE >` creates and runs all files and combines the predictions into a single score.txt
```
python bash/genbash_test.py --yaml YAML  Main Yaml File
                            --bash BASH_FILE  Location of Bash File
bash bash/< BASH_FILE >
```

# To generate the submission file - 
```
python submission.py [-h] [--scores_file CSV FILE GENERATED IN TESTING]
```

## PreTrained Model + Easy-Inference
You can find the pre-trained ECAPA-TDNN model with an easy-inference function on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/speechbrain/spkrec-ecapa-voxceleb).
